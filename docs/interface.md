General

Most of the screen is the map. On the right is an Info panel. It might just be something that pops up when a planet is selected. On the bottom (or top?) is the effect button panel. Important global stats (just HQ gold?) may be on top. 

Planet

Click on unselected planet:
Selects the planet. The selected planet could be highlighted by lightening the color and/or by putting a circle around it. The full stats of the planet and incoming and outgoing routes should be shown in the info panel. If there is no outgoing route, there should be a note to shift-click on another planet to create a route.

Click on select planet:
Unselects it.

Shift-Click on planet when another planet is selected:
Create a route from the selected planet to this one. 

Info Panel:
There could be a "Recall Route" button for every route.

Effect Panel:
This should have a toggle button for every kind of area effect.  Each button should have a bar next to it showing the amount you have of the good that allows that effect. If the bar is too low, the button is inactive, and clicking it does nothing.

Click unselected active effect panel button: Toggles that button to selected. Change cursor when it's over the map to show that you can place an effect.

Click map when an effect button is selected:
Creates an area effect in that position and removes quantity of the good used for the effect.

Hover over route:
Would be nice to show stats on the route in a little pop up box when you hover over it. Most of this info is in the info panel for the origin planet, but it'd be good to show the speed at the particular spot that you're hovering.

Hover over effect: 
Show what the effect there is.
