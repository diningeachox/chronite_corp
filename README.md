Since this project imports THREE.js from a CDN, it must be run from a server. There are apps which let you setup your own server on your local machine. If you're using Chrome, I recommend [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?hl=en)

1. Start the server
